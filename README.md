# MoviesApp

CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPEMENT. 

Short description: Imagine that you and your partner decide to spend the evening chilling, just the two of you, snacks and a movie. But neither you or your partner can't decice what to watch. So you spend long hours deciding and sometimes don't reach any conclusion which satisfies both of you. But what if you give the task of choosing movies to mere chance? Just choose the genre, press the button and you will get the random movie. This is "MoviesApp" that I will try to create. 

V0.1 : in first version, I made API that in one list shows all popular movies, accornding to themoviedb.org users. It was done to test if my API key really works with my code. 

Future features: my end result should be mobile app that I would use to randomly selecting movies.
