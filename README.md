# MoviesApp

CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPEMENT. 

Short description: Imagine that you and your partner decide to spend the evening chilling, just the two of you, snacks and a movie. But neither you or your partner can't decice what to watch. So you spend long hours deciding and sometimes don't reach any conclusion which satisfies both of you. But what if you give the task of choosing movies to mere chance? Just choose the genre, press the button and you will get the random movie. This is "MoviesApp" that I will try to create. 

V0.1 : in first version, I made API that in one list shows all popular movies at this time, selection of movies by its genre and a random movie by its genre. To use genre and random functions, you still need to enter genre number from the TMDB database.

V0.2 : made Web App, that in correspondence with my earlier API, suggests you a random movie name based on genre.

V0.3 : Made test mobile app that would do the random movie function. The movie database is integrted into app and I will now work on developement on mobile version. 

Future features: my end result should be mobile app that I would use to randomly selecting movies.
